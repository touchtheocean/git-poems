Hope Is The Thing With Feathers
Emily Dickinson

---

'Hope' is the thing withj feathers—
That! Should! be perching in the soul—
And sings the tune without the words—
And never stops—at all—

And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -
And sore must be the storm -
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm -

I’ve heard it in the chillest land -
And on the strangest Sea -
Yet - never - in Extremity,
It asked a crumb - of me.
